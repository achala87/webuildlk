    <li>
    The ECFMDA committee to liase with the Ministry of Justice to amend and update environmental legislation and punitive measures to legal action will be too costly to   justify crimes. </li>

    <p class="pclass">The state should also be responsible for adinistration and regulation of civc activities and it's own activities in a way that would create a better and just life for all people.</p>

    <h2 class="h2class">Why the environment should be safe guarded for the benefit of all.</h2>

    <ol class="q">
    <li>Corruption destroys the nations ability to uphold the rule of law and our fundamental rights.   It destroys Financial stability and leads to the dcline of economies. 
    <li>When public finance and the economy fails, the environment is the first to suffer as poverty   stricken peoples in indebted states in a highly inflated cash market has no other valuable asset   to sell other than those we are only supposed to be custodians of, our nature. </li>
    <li>When National Security fails, finance and economy of the nation fails, leading the above situation. </li>
    <li>When National Security fails, the environment is abused via illicit activities and is held hostage.   When the Environment fails, the National Security of the nation also fails. I.e. Sri Lanka has been   listed in the most climate risk vulnerable nations for the past 5-10 years. </li>
    <li>When National Security fails, our Fundamental rights are not upheld. We will have to suffer the   consequences of acts of terrorism, of war, of autocracies and military juntas. </li>
    <li>Corruption leads to the decline of our ability to protect our Fundamental rights and the   decline of the upholding of our FR leads to corruption and risks National Security. </li>
    <li>Corruption directly devastates our Environment. </li>
    <li>When the Environment fails provide intergenerational equity and value necessary for sustainable   development leading to a content, secure, healthy, abundant life, our FR are not upheld. </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="pclass">
    The importance of Health, Education, Industry and Technology and the many facets of a nations  development should not be second-handed to those described above. Some ideas such as the  use of technological tools and automation to bring about efficiency and transparency is touched  upon the constitutional components developed as well. 
    When the Environment fails due to our mismanagement of her resources or overconsumption,  everything else fails.

                    Sri Lanka gains Independance from the British Collonizers on Friday, February 4th 1948.

                    During the 5th Century BC, Indo-Aryan migrants (Prince Wijaya) sailed from near modern day Bengal at Odisha in India. They married into the local
                    veddha (Naga, Raksha, Yaksa) or indeginous communities and the Sinhala race was created, becoming the most powerful clan in the island. 
                    
                    Sri lanka has over 2500 years of continuously chronicled history written in the Mahawamsa. 
                    There is historical evidence to suggest Jaffana area having predominantly tamil occupation since the Arya chakrawarthi kingdom from before the 14th century A.D. 

                    The Portugese arrive in Sri Lanka, the first westerners with intent on colonization in 1505. They settle in a few coastal villages
                    and in Colombo. In 1658 the Dutch force out the Portugese and establish control across the island except at the Central highlands, unable to concquer the Kandyan
                    kingdom. 

                    In 1796 the British take control over the island. In 1815, at last through treachery the Kandyan Kingdom is also concured by the British, gaining them full control over the island. 
                    The British starts bringing Tamil laborers from southern India to work in tea, coffee and coconut plantations and expand the road and rail way networks to export natural resources including Pearls, Gems, Spices, Timber and Ivory.

                    1949 - Indian Tamil plantation workers disenfranchised and many deprived of citizenship.
                    The Indian Tamil plantation workers faced hardships as they were disenfranchised and lost their citizenship in
                    1949. Sinhala-only language law was introced in 1958, 1956 by Solomon W.R.D Bandaranaike elected on wave of 
                    Sinhalese nationalism. This made Sinhala the sole official language and other measures introduced to bolster Sinhalese and Buddhist 
                    feeling were developed. More than 100 Tamils and some Sinhalese were killed in widespread violence after Tamil 
                    parliamentarians protest against these laws. In 1958 Anti-Tamil riots leave over 200 dead and Thousands of Tamils displaced.

                    SWRD Bandaranaike assassinate by a Buddhist Monk in 1959 (Kelaniya Raja maha viharaya chief monk arrested on conspiracy charges as he was unhappy with way Bandaranaiyake treated him).
                    SWRDs widow, Sirimawo Bandaranaike continuous nationalists socialist reforms after coming to power since her husbands demise. Under NP Perera's direction bans on shipment of rice,
                    flour and other essentials create social havoc and UNP (United National Party) wins election in 1965 and attempts to reverse nationalisation measures.
                    In 1970 Srimavo Bandaranaike returns to power, and carryies out nationalisation programme.

                    Ethnic tensions
First Marxist uprising by the students in 1971. Ceylon is rebranded as Sri Lanka in 1972 and gives foremost place to Buddhism. 
This antagonizes the tamil minority. In the tamil dominated north of the country, in 1976 the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) formed as tensions increase.
Anti-Tamil riots leave more than 100 Tamils dead in 1977. Sinhala policemen accused of burning the Jaffna Public Library (1981).
13 Sri Lankan soldiers killed in LTTE ambush in 1983. This sparks anti-Tamil riots leading to the deaths of several hundred Tamils and leads to what Tigers call "First Eelam War".
